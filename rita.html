				<h2>How does Google influence our lives through advertisements?</h2>
				<p>He sees you when you’re sleeping. He knows when you’re awake. Who is ‘he’? Dr. Google, that’s who. Google’s multitude of digital services has become a staple in our daily routines. One component of the billion dollar business is advertisements. They appear on the side of almost all the websites that you visit and affect us in subtle ways. All in all, Google’s advertising system has a negative effect on our lives. First and foremost, it invades our privacy. Google uses cookies (not the tasty kind) to track and store your online usage (Google, "How Google uses cookies"). This means that your personal information such as your location and also how you use a given website is recorded in Google’s database. Some may disregard this information and view it as trivial, but many users see it as intrusive and a violation. Furthermore, their advertising system manipulates its own users. Google uses the information from your cookies to customize the ads that you see on the side of your screen (Google, “Types of cookies used by Google”). For instance, if, one day, you visit a website about the Bahamas, you may start to notice advertisements for Caribbean travel agencies. Google is essentially using your browser history against you for their corporate motives. Finally, Google favours investing corporations over its users. While Google doesn’t directly sell your data to the advertising companies, they are constantly profiting from your data collection. Companies looking for advertising space pay Google for access to your specific screen (Hildenbrand, "Ask AC: Does Google sell your personal data?"). Google creates a profile based on the type of websites you visit. Then, they use that profile to match you to an advertiser that sells products in your range of interests (which is based off of your viewing history). So, Google’s partnerships with these companies benefit from the user’s personal information. On the whole, Google ads are not as innocent as they seem. In the end, they force us to truly think about the nature of our online activity.

				<h2>Google Ads and The Global Village</h2>
				<p>
					Marshall McLuhan was a prominent Canadian professor who, in the 1960’s, created a collection of theories analyzing media and society (Gordon, “Who was Marshall McLuhan?”). Among these theories is the concept of a global village.
				</p>
				<p>
					The global village is the idea that modern media and technology connect the world together, transforming the globe onto a communal village. McLuhan predicted that technology would create a sort of neural network between citizens of the world, where two people across the world from each other could simultaneously experience the same event (Stewart, "Marshall McLuhan Predicts The Global Village").
				</p>
				<div class="jumbotron">
					<img src="global-village.jpg">
				</div>
				<p>	
					McLuhan himself viewed the global village in a negative light. He believed that the integration caused by the global village would force society into savagery. Rather than collaborating through this new electronic form of communication, the members of society in the global village would wind up antagonizing and aggravating each other (Clausen, "The “Global Village” is Never Harmonious”).
				</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					An example McLuhan’s global village is the extremist terrorist group Boko Haram. In 2014, the group abducted 300 schoolgirls and posted a video online. The video featured some of the abducted girls being guarded by Boko Haram members, who were masked and carrying AK-47s. This video is one of many propaganda videos released by the group, which include beheadings, dead bodies and other atrocities. Boko Haram uses electronic communication (in this case social media) to spread terror across the globe (Quist-Arcton, "Boko Haram Takes A Page From ISIS Propaganda Playbook").

				</div>
				<p>
					If McLuhan were alive today to analyze the media of Google, he would not see it as revolutionary. Rather, to McLuhan, it would send the globe into a state of primitiveness. The Google search engine has turned all societies into one common village. When everyone has access to the same information, they lose their individuality and everyone tries to gain the upper hand. They abuse the media and technology for their personal gain.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular, Google ads abuse their global reach. Instead of the global village living in harmony, its members are trapped in a perpetual game of cat and mouse. Google, the cat, chases the user, the mouse, in the sense that Google pursues its users for money. Google has the ability to connect continents together, yet, they only use their power to create a primal and tribal village of profit and greed.
