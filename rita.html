				<h2>How does Google influence our lives through advertisements?</h2>
				<p>        He sees you when you’re sleeping. He knows when you’re awake. Who is ‘he’? Dr. Google, that’s who. Google’s multitude of digital services has become a staple in our daily routines. One component of the billion dollar business is advertisements. They appear on the side of almost all the websites that you visit and affects us in subtle ways. All in all, Google’s advertising system has a negative effect on our lives. First and foremost, it invades our privacy. Google uses cookies (not the tasty kind) to track and store your online usage (Google, "How Google uses cookies"). This means that your personal information such as your location and also how you use a given website is recorded in Google’s database. Some may disregard this information and view it as trivial, but many users see it as intrusive and a violation. Furthermore, their advertising system manipulates its own users. Google uses the information from your cookies to customize the ads that you see on the side of your screen (Google, “Types of cookies used by Google”). For instance, if, one day, you visit a website about the Bahamas, you may start to notice advertisements for Caribbean travel agencies. Google is essentially using your browser history against you for their corporate motives. Finally, Google favours investing corporations over its users. While Google doesn’t directly sell your data to the advertising companies, they are constantly profiting from your data collection. Companies looking for advertising space pay Google for access to your specific screen (Hildenbrand, "Ask AC: Does Google sell your personal data?"). Google creates a profile based on the type of websites you visit. Then, they use that profile to match you to an advertiser that sells products in your range of interests (which is based of off your viewing history). So, Google’s partnerships with these companies benefit from the user’s personal information. On the whole, Google ads are not as innocent as they seem. In the end, they force us to truly think about the nature of our online activity.
