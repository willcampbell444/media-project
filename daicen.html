				<h2>How does Google influence today’s culture?</h2>
				<p>When was the first moon landing? The invention of the toaster? How do I fix my sink? Just google it. From giving us instant access to information for school projects or to proving someone wrong, there is no debate that google has become a big part of our lives. However, with so much data being easily accessible it has also affected our culture, especially the way we interact with each other. Our interactions with others have become less and less personal as we rely more on technology. One example of this is in the classroom. With the access to endless amount of information, students tend to lean towards Google to learn as opposed to their teachers. This applies mainly to classes that are more information based such as science courses where I have noticed that a lot of students simply google their questions instead of asking the teacher. This recedes the connection between the student and the teacher making the teacher less and less significant in the student’s education since they now prefer to do everything through Google. With the use of Google, significant first meetings have also changed; people nowadays can easily search up whoever they’re meeting up with. By having so much information about other people in such an accessible form, it changes the way we communicate in a rather strange way. Now the person you are meeting with may already know you and all of your interests. This also makes people become a bit obsessive when it comes to meeting new people, with so much information available; they feel the need to know all about them in order to not say the wrong things. Having this mentality can make conversations less genuine and more divided as each person would be busy thinking of what they should say rather than what they want to say. Lastly, as we are constantly exposed to tragic news all around the world, experts say that it can even hinder our empathy. As Cliff Nass, a communications professor at Stanford says: “Perhaps the most troubling consequence of devoting so much attention to the virtual world is the death of empathy”. In his interview he mentions how we are consuming media like popcorn; with the use of Google we are exposed to so many tragic events that it no longer really fazes us. Empathy is a very important trait that allows us to put ourselves in other people’s shoes, and it is what makes conversations feel sincere and personal. Nonetheless, these effects are inevitable consequences of our growth in technology, our culture is always changing according to our environment so as technology keeps changing so will we.</p>

				<h2>Hot and Cool Media</h2>

				<p>Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian philosopher most known for his study in media theory and the phrase, “the medium is the message”. One of McLuhan’s lesser known theories is his theory of hot and cool media that was first mentioned in his book Understanding Media in 1964. His idea states that media can be categorized as hot or cool. Hot media would be any form of media that does not require much participation from the audience or where the medium provides the information so that the audience would not need to be engaged. A classic example would be the radio where it simply gives news; everything is done with an order and with high definition and requires no participation from the listener. A cool medium on the other hand is a medium that does require active participation from the audience. An example of this would be a phone conversation, where the user has to be engaged and has the power to alter the message based on the way they interpret it (Reappraising Marshall McLuhan’s Distinction Between Hot & Cool Media).</p>

				<p>Nowadays, our media has developed to be a lot cooler, one way is through the advancement of technology since with higher definition movies and photos, it leaves less room for interpretation with blurry images as people needed to do in the past. Another reason why our medium has become cooler may have been as McLuhan himself suggested, in an interview with Playboy Magazine. McLuhan used his theory of hot and cool media to try to explain why Kennedy was doing much better on TV than Nixon. He explain how Kennedy had a certain type of ‘coolness’ that allows the audience complete his words by adding their own interpretation as he says: “Any political candidate who doesn't have such cool, low definition qualities, which allow the viewer to fill in the gaps with his own personal identification, simply electrocutes himself on television” (The Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan).</p>

				</div>

				<p>In the short clip of the debate we can pick out what McLuhan meant by ‘coolness’, Kennedy tends to ask more rhetorical questions and also use ‘our’ and ‘we’ to further connect with the viewers while Nixon liked to state facts and concrete information. Although Nixon’s method would do well in written form, McLuhan concludes that television is a different medium which requires a different approach.</p>

				<p>Going back to Google, would the search engine be considered as a hot or cool medium? Most would say it’s a relativity cool medium since it allows the user to type into the search engine and also allows the user to pick and choose the links they want to look at. This is much cooler than its alternative in the past which are encyclopaedias where the user does not have much room for choice. By giving more choices to the user, it allows people to explore new things that are not necessarily what is usually broadcasted on television or radio. People now have the freedom to listen to the songs they like and learn about the kind of news they want to know instead of listening to whatever is broadcasted on TV or radio. This shift to cool media adds a lot more variety into our culture as each person will be able to learn what they want to learn. We can see the result of this with the rising popularity of international music, as “Despacito” a latin pop song by Puerto Rican artists Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee becomes the latest sensation all around the globe as is currently number one on the iTunes Top Charts.</p>

				<p>Another thing to keep in mind while understanding McLuhan’s hot and cool theory is to know that everything is relative. While Google is considered as a cool media, there are some aspects that make it hot such as the way it suggests sites and how the sites are ordered to lure users into clicking it first. The best way to think of it is as a spectrum and to compare it with other forms of media and to see where it stands relative to it.</p>

									This allows anyone with internet access to learn a new skill very easily and also in the comfort of their own house. It also gives a lot more opportunities for people that do not have access to a tutor to learn something that they are passionate about. Now people can learn a new instrument, a new language and even how to program with the use of Google. It expands the privilege of knowledge to more people and also allows people to learn at their own pace, away from the traditional environment of a classroom.

								<p>
									This shows that even though resources may be available, it does not mean everyone is going to take advantage of it. Courses like History are usually thought as the ‘boring’ course since nobody want to sit around and memorise facts when everything is already on Google. However, knowing the country’s history is a key part of understanding how the country works now which is important when the student gets a chance to contribute to the country for example through voting. This shows that nowadays, getting the information is an easy step, but making people understand why the information is important is the hard part.
