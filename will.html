								<ul>
									<li>
										Google personalizes results based on previous searches so girls will end up getting different results than guys because of searching for things that girls generally find more interesting than guys do. This perpetuates gender roles and further separates the interests of each gender.
									</li>
									<li>
										Men and women tend to search differently, and because the search engine was made almost entirely by men, it is more tailored to their style of searching
									</li>
									<li>
										Makes it easier to discover the differences between genders, which can exacerbate them

								<ul>
									<li>
										Anyone can use it so it enables those who are historically less educated to pursue knowledge on their own. This lowers the gap in educational levels between genders.
									</li>
									<li>
										Spreads information about both genders, so they can learn about each other and better understand the similarities between the genders.
									</li>
									<li>
										Makes it easier to discover and read about gender equality. This helps people learn about the imbalances and leads to people trying to minimize them.
