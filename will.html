				<h2>Does Google facilitate Access to Information</h2>

				<p>Thanks to the Internet, information is easier to access than ever. It is estimated that over 3.7 billion people have used the Internet as of March 2017 where Google specifically total up to 3.5 billion searches per day. The Internet is where we go to apply to college, answer important questions, and even find jobs. To everyone aside from 60 million that do not use the Internet, Google is just about the most useful current invention. Google facilitates access to information by being convenient, instant, and having the answer to just about everything and anything. First, Google facilitates access to information because it is convenient. Anyone; adults, children, or teenagers are easily attracted to Google because it is easy to use. It has a clean, simple layout and is not at all confusing to navigate around. Compared to the traditional, old fashioned way of finding information by reading books, textbooks, or research papers, we can simply type a couple of words into a search bar and instantly get the answer. Even for older people in their 30s and 40s, where technology is not their strongest area, statistics showed that 22.6% of users were between the ages of 35 and 44 in 2016. With 13.3% of users between the ages of 18 and 24, and 5.4% of users over the ages of 65, Google is a medium where age is just a number and is unlimited and unrestricted. Second, Google facilitates access to information because it is instantaneous. When we look up anything in Google, just below the search bar it tells us, for example; About 11,680,000,000 results (0.70 seconds). This means that billions of results come up in less than 1 second. You can also use Google’s cached version of a web page, which is often even faster than the page itself. In a busy society that is constantly wanting for everything to be fast and quick, Google does just that in an instant and gives us access to billions and billions of information. Third, Google facilitates access to information because it has the answers to everything and anything. Whether we want to learn how to cook a pineapple upside down cake or fix the toilet, Google has the answer. The top searches each year reveal that people don’t search for how to do something or the answer to something but a news story about politics, celebrities, athletes, or etc. The top trending search term of the year 2015 was “Lamar Odom” after he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. People also searched for movies such as “Jurassic park” and “American Sniper”. Whether people want to learn a new language or are just curious about what is happening around the world, Google is always the first place people go to search whatever their heart desires. To conclude, Google is a useful tool that helps us have easy and quick access to information anytime and anywhere. By focusing on just the positive aspects of Google in terms of its ability to facilitate access to information all around the world, we are able to step back and realize just how much of an important invention Google is in our daily lives.</p>

				<h2>Gender Criticism of Google Search Engine</h2>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Google personalizes results based on previous searches so girls will end up getting different results than guys because of searching for things that girls generally find more interesting than guys do. This perpetuates gender roles and further separates the interests of each gender.
									</li>
									<li>
										Men and women tend to search differently, and because the search engine was made almost entirely by men, it is more tailored to their style of searching
									</li>
									<li>
										Makes it easier to discover the differences between genders, which can exacerbate them
									</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Anyone can use it so it enables those who are historically less educated to pursue knowledge on their own. This lowers the gap in educational levels between genders.
									</li>
									<li>
										Spreads information about both genders, so they can learn about each other and better understand the similarities between the genders.
									</li>
									<li>
										Makes it easier to discover and read about gender equality. This helps people learn about the imbalances and leads to people trying to minimize them.
