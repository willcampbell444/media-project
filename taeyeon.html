				<h2>Does Google encourage the spread of false information?</h2>

				<p>
					Google is a search engine that has naturally become embedded in a part of our daily lives. While many aspects of Google are beneficial and necessary, it however also inevitably can be utilized in a way that was not necessarily the intended meaning. As any type of invention and advancement, the consequences and the negative outcomes are inevitable and cannot be avoided. Google falls into this inevitably by its tendency to encourage the spread of false information by being an available medium for delivery of information, being internationally available whenever and wherever, and the freedom of opinion. First, Google encourages the spread of false information by being an available medium for the delivery of information. There are currently multiple mediums that have the sole purpose of delivering information and the sometimes the sources of these information are not completely reliable. Even government sites that prove to be the most reliable out of all sources of information on the Internet, were found to not be completely accurate. In 2011, the Canadian government reported that an estimate of 186,000 jobs would be created different to 121,000 jobs actually created that year. This shows that any forms of information on the Internet are easily manipulated and as a medium, Google facilitates this happening. Second, Google encourages the spread of false information by being internationally available and accessible whenever and wherever.  In 2014, a top 10 list of most concerning societal issues, amongst global issues such as rising social tension in Middle East and North Africa, widening income disparities, number 10 was the rapid spread of misinformation online. This demonstrates the extent and importance of this problem. How do they spread? Through different mediums of social media where search engines such as Google is an existing medium for the spread. No matter where you are in the world, if you are connected to the internet, you have access to all types of information no matter the time. This makes it very convenient for anyone to possibly misunderstand in different countries and religions. Last, Google encourages the spread of false information by the freedom of opinion. People are able to share anything they want and this can cause various opinions and encourage the spread of facts that are not even correct. When researchers analyzed the first 100 websites that came up in Google when they looked up “Infant sleep position”, they discovered that only 43.5% of the 1300 websites contained information that were inline with AAP (medical accuracy) and 28.1% contained inaccurate information.  We must note that these are people on the internet that are not qualified doctors or historians that are posting information they want to. Although Google is a useful medium, we shouldn’t rely on it so extensively. In conclusion, Google is a necessity in the 21st century and continues to allow us to live the convenient lives that we do. However we must keep in mind that everything uploaded on the internet is not always necessarily accurate information and from unreliable sources, more likely to be false information. As long as we keep this in mind, Google will continue to be a positive medium in our daily lives.
